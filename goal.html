        <p>Our goal is to grow and make an impact. We aim to develop as a company and install our machines in as many schools as possible.
        Then, if everything goes well, we hope to be present not only in schools but also in companies.
        Imagine hundreds and even thousands of persons changing their consomation to eco-friendly meals, this would be a first step towards a better planet.
